## [Project 1: Hotel Booking Demand Analysis](https://github.com/rifqinurpermadi/Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis)  
This project was completed as part of the **RevoU Final Project**, where our group achieved a final grade of **91.25/100 (A)**. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.  

### Key Tasks:  
- Identified the causes of high cancellation rates in city hotel bookings using **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**.  
- Analyzed strategies to reduce the booking cancellation rate at city hotels.  
- Developed an **analytical dashboard** using [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/4e7aa8d1-d1dd-43bf-bf2a-5f2ab064096d/page/p_1fhi72gmad).

## [Project 2: Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/rifqinurpermadi/Sentiment-Analysis)  
This project analyzes public sentiment regarding the **2024 Indonesian Presidential and Vice Presidential Second Debate** on X/Twitter. The data was collected via Twitter data crawling. The analysis was conducted following the **CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology.  

### Key Tasks:  
- Extracted Twitter data using the **Tweet Harvest API**.  
- Labeled tweet sentiment using a **lexicon-based approach**.  
- Built an **accurate and reliable sentiment analysis model** to assess public responses to the debate.  
- Developed a **dashboard** for sentiment analysis and prediction using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** in [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/d7ddc925-e23b-456b-91fe-9baa877af4a0/page/Ues9D).  

### Methodology:  
The **CRISP-DM** framework was used in this project, consisting of:  
1. **Business Understanding** â€“ Identifying key research questions and objectives.  
2. **Data Understanding** â€“ Collecting and preprocessing Twitter data.  
3. **Data Preparation** â€“ Cleaning and labeling tweets for sentiment analysis.  
4. **Modeling** â€“  
   In this stage, sentiment prediction models were built using three different algorithms: **Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest**. The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy for further evaluation and deployment. The experiment was conducted using three different train-test ratios: **80%-20%, 70%-30%, and 60%-40%**.  
5. **Evaluation** â€“  
   In this stage, the best-performing model was evaluated using the test data with the highest accuracy. The **SVM model with an 80%-20% train-test ratio** achieved the highest accuracy and was selected for further analysis and deployment.  
6. **Deployment** â€“ Visualizing sentiment analysis results through an interactive dashboard.
